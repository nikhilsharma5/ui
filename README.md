Frameworks
(Express) Node itself can’t do all of these and you need a framework to perform such ops.
    - If you want to make http calls
    - Handle requests are diff. Url paths
    - Or generate dynamic response
    - Diff. Between using a framework and node directly is that you won’t have to write as much code
    - const express = require('express'); —> used to import express module
